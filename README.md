# Social Network

## Overview

This project involves the creation of an API for a social network web application, designed to allow users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage a friends list. Utilizing MongoDB for its database due to its efficiency with large datasets and flexibility with unstructured data, this challenge is a cornerstone for understanding the backend structure of social networking platforms. The API will be built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) tool to facilitate operations on the database.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database known for its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Perfect for social network applications that handle vast amounts of user-generated content.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, including powerful routing.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, and business logic hooks.
- **JavaScript Date Library (Optional)**: You may choose to use a JavaScript date library of your choice or stick with the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps within the application.

## Features

- **User Management**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profile. Profiles include personal information and the option to add or remove friends from their friends list.
- **Thought Sharing**: Users can post their thoughts, view a feed of their friends' thoughts, and manage their posts. This includes creating, updating, and deleting thoughts.
- **Reactions**: Users can react to their own or their friends' thoughts, providing a dynamic and interactive experience. Each thought can have multiple reactions, adding a layer of engagement to the platform.
- **Friend List Management**: Users can create and manage a list of friends, allowing for a personalized social network experience. The friend list feature facilitates the sharing and reaction mechanisms by determining who can see and interact with whom.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**:
   - Ensure that you have MongoDB installed on your system.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies including Express.js and Mongoose.

2. **Configuration**:
   - Set up your MongoDB connection in a configuration file or through environment variables.
   - Configure the Express.js server and set up the routing as needed for the application.

3. **Running the Application**:
   - Start the server using `npm start` or a similar command configured in your `package.json`.
   - Utilize Postman or any API testing tool to test the routes and ensure they are functioning as expected.

## Documentation

Refer to the Express.js and Mongoose documentation for detailed information on routing, schema definitions, and database operations. Additionally, consider looking into documentation for your chosen JavaScript date library if you decide to use one.
